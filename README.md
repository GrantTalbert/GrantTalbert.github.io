TODO
- refactor the fucking css
    - A lot of the css is repeated across multiple main files - lets break it out into separate things like a good dev and just import them when necessary
- edit the content on the projects page
- add more images on the about page and make it more cutesy
- edit the colors on the projects page and possibly modify the colors overall
- modify the about page text
- modify the home page look
- possibly change up the explosions per-theme
    - tensors and math symbols exploding sound awesome
- MAKE THE FUCKING CHALKBOARDS HAVE WHITE TEXT HELLOOOOOOO
- also add a skip button for the animations (the long one does indeed get annoying)
