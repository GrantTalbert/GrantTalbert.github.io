    # good mod
    ## a QOL mod for Hypixel Skyblock, a Minecraft Server

    problem: looting dungeon chests takes time because you have to calculate the profit in each one
    solution: lots of mods have profit calculators
    problem: theyre all TRASH
    solution: GOOD MOD!!!! (yes, i actually called it that)

    - implements profit calc
    - profit calc highlights the best slot to click
    - somehow highlights it better than all the other mods
    - also highlights a second chest if its worth it
    - somehow no one else did that
    - im just better
    - the code is held together by tears and hopes and dreams
    - download good mod today!!!!!!
