    # good mod
    ## a QOL mod for Hypixel Skyblock, a Minecraft Server

    problem: looting dungeon chests require MATH to figure out which is the most profit
    problem: i'm a math major so obviously i don't know how to do arithmetic
    solution: lots of already popular mods have profit calculators for dungeon chests
    problem: theyre all TRASH
    solution: ðŸŒŸ GOOD MOD!!!! ðŸŒŸ (yes, i actually called it that)

    good mod is a fun little project I worked on even after I quit playing skyblock, and it's where most of my Kotlin experience comes from.
    (Shoutout to OdTheKing for helping me get started with the code!!! It's mostly developed by me though :D)

    - implements profit calc
    - profit calc highlights the best slot to click
    - somehow highlights it better than all the other mods?
    - also highlights a second chest if its worth it
    - somehow no one else did that
    - im just better
    - oh except NEU but no one likes NEU also mine will be better later when i add more stuff
    - the code is held together by hopes and dreams
    - omg that was an undertale reference
    - download good mod today!!!!!!
