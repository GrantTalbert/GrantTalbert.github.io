        We used this book for my first undergraduate quantum class. We only covered about half of it, and were supposed to
        finish in the second undergrad quantum class.

        Issue is that BU's quantum scheduling is TRASH!!! Ugrad quantum 1/2 only run in the spring/fall respectively, and grad quantum
        1/2 only run in the fall/spring respectively. I DONT HAVE ENOUGH CLASS SLOTS to take ugrad quantum 2 & grad quantum 1 at the
        same time, AND THEY RUN AT LITERALLY THE SAME TIME LIKE WTF

        so I just skipped ugrad quantum 2 and am gunna read it from the book instead over the summer. I got a copy of the syllabus for our ugrad
        quantum 2 class to ensure I'm getting all the material I needed.

        I haven't started reading yet since school is still in session so juggling more than 2 books is REALLY HARD but I'll update with
        more precise reading dates when I do!!!
