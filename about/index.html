      Hi, I'm Grant! I'm an undergrad at BU, and I double major in physics and math. I intend to go to grad school in physics, and I'm mostly interested in mathematical QFT and high-energy physics. I also love math, and am currently very interested in higher category theory. My interests in math change every 2-3 months though, but in general I'm interested in some of the more abstract areas of math.

      I spend a lot of my free time learning math and physics. I genuinely love learning about things I'm interested in, and will happily sit down and work through a textbook for fun. I also have very ambitious reading plans for the next two years.
