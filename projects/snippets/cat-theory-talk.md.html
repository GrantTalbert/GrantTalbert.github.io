# A Friendly Introduction to Abstract Nonsense

This is a presentation I gave to the BU math club (actually only one of them; for some reason theres 3 right now???). The goal of the talk was to give
a *friendly* introduction to category theory, targetted at undergraduates. The only background knowledge I assumed was to "have some idea of what a set
is." I wrote some fire lecture notes to accompany my talk, which I'm sharing here! The talk was split into two main parts, **basic notions** and
**special topics**.

## Basic Categorical Notions

Since the talk was targetted at undergraduates at any level, I couldn't assume any background knowledge in algebra or topology or anything. This made
motivating category theory kinda difficult, so I chose to begin with the following topics. Some assume knowledge in higher level topics like algebra,
but some don't:

- viewing the cartesian product as a universal property
- the first isomorphism theorem, and it's near omnipresence in algebraic settings

I then defined a category as a way of shifting viewpoints to one focused more on functions and relations. I continued with some canonical examples, Set,
Grp,  Top, etc., and then did a poset category to show that the definition of morphisms is exceedingly broad.

One of my goals of the talk was to cover the Yoneda Lemma, so I proceeded by defining functors, and giving some examples such as Hom. I then defined
natural transformations as a way of going between functors, and jumped right into Yoneda's lemma. I love the philosophical impacts of it, so I wanted
to showcase it. I then wrapped up this section with a discussion of universal properties, because of course.

## Advanced Topics

This section was me cramming in some topics I thought were important, but more advanced, and my writing slowly becomes less and less friendly and more
"here's a new insane looking abstraction, let's prove this thing about it then move on". I went through a formalism of universality via universal arrows,
which I used to introduce adjunctions. I then discussed adjunctions, and gave the interpretations as a natural isomorphism of hom-sets and unit-counits.
I then introduced limits and colimits as another formalism for universal properties. I then introduced monads, reviewed how an adjunction induces a monad,
then introduced monoids, attempted to prove a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, and got bored partway through lmaoooo

I only got through Yoneda's lemma when I actually gave the talk xd
