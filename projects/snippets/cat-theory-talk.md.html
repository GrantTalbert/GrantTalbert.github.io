# A Friendly Introduction to Abstract Nonsense

This is a presentation I gave to the BU math club (actually only one of them; for some reason theres 3 right now???). The goal of the talk was to give a *friendly* introduction to category theory, targetted at undergraduates. The only background knowledge I assumed was to "have some idea of what a set is." I used a combo of beamer and the whiteboards for my presentation, and wrote detailed "lecture notes" to accompany them. The talk was structured into three main parts.

## Motivation

Since the talk was targetted at undergraduates at any level, I couldn't assume any background knowledge in algebra or topology or anything. This made motivating category theory kinda difficult, so I chose to begin with the following topics. Some assume knowledge in higher level topics like algebra, but most don't.

- I started by discussing functions and some of their properties that generalize categorically, like injective -> monomorphism
- Then I presented the construction of the cartesian product as a universal property. Since people are familiar with cartesian products, and the proof is not difficult, I thought it was a great way to show constructions can be characterized solely by using functions and diagrams. I also presented the quotient set construction, since I wanted to reference it later
- I finished with some brief considerations for my more advanced attendees. Most of my audience had algebra experience, and some had topology experience, so I focused on these subjects. I claimed these constructions generalize to the direct products and quotients of groups, rings, and topological spaces, but by replacing "function" with "group/ring homomorphism or continuous map".
