    <p class="animated-text">
      Hi, I'm Grant! I'm an undergrad at BU, and I double major in physics and math. I intend to go to grad school in physics, and I'm mostly interested in mathematical QFT and high-energy physics. I also love math, and am currently very interested in higher category theory. My interests in math change every 2-3 months though, but in general I'm interested in some of the more abstract areas of math.
    </p>
    <p class="animated-text">
      I spend a lot of my free time learning math and physics. I genuinely love learning about things I'm interested in, and will happily sit down and work through a textbook for fun. I also have very ambitious reading plans for the next two years.
    </p>
    <p class="animated-text">
      I'm also very fluent in LaTeX, and have created my own package to manage my title pages, and have many different templates for my notes and assignments. I also have a suite of scripts that streamline my LaTeX workflow - both for note-taking and homework assignments. I've also coded my own Minecraft mod, which is fittingly named "good mod", and I use arch (btw).
