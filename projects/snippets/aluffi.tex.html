        This is where I first saw category theory!!! Aluffi will always hold a special place in my heart for that ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–

        I started reading Aluffi in mid december 2024, and ``finished'' in mid April 2025.

        I kindaaaa skipped the entire middle section of the book BUT OK MULTILINEAR ALGEBRA AND HOMOLOGICAL ALGEBRA just sounded SO COOL im NOT sitting through 4 more chapters before getting to those like CMON
